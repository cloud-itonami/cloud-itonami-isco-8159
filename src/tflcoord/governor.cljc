  "TflCoordGovernor — the independent safety/scope layer gating every
  plant scheduling/logistics proposal an advisor may make for a
  textile, fur and leather products machine-operations crew (ISCO-08
  8159, a residual 'Not Elsewhere Classified' code covering diverse
  textile/fur/leather machine-operation work not captured by more
  specific ISCO 815x codes; standard industrial-machine hazards —
  entanglement, crush injury from varied machinery — apply generically,
  without a single dominant hazard type). The governor never dispatches
  hardware itself, never operates textile/fur/leather machinery itself,
  and never finalizes a machine-operation-execution decision (e.g.
  deciding to proceed with a specific textile/fur/leather machine run)
  or a plant-safety-clearance decision (e.g. declaring a plant or
  production line safe for operation), and never overrides a plant
  safety officer's judgment — those are permanently out of this actor's
  scope and remain a plant safety officer's exclusive judgment (README's
  'Robotics premise': this actor coordinates PLANT SCHEDULING/LOGISTICS
  ONLY — it never operates textile/fur/leather machinery itself).
  Modeled closely on cloud-itonami-isco-8122's platingcoord.governor.

  HARD invariants (:hard? true, ALWAYS :hold, never overridable):
    1. operator provenance   — the crew member must be independently
                                verified/registered before any action.
    2. plant provenance      — the textile/fur/leather plant/line must
                                be independently verified/registered
                                before any action.
    3. no-actuation           — proposal :effect must be :propose (the
                                governor never dispatches hardware and
                                never operates textile/fur/leather
                                machinery itself; it only gates what
                                the advisor may coordinate).
    4. closed op-allowlist    — only :log-work-record,
                                :schedule-crew-operation,
                                :flag-safety-concern and
                                :coordinate-supply-order may ever be
                                proposed; anything else is refused.
    5. scope-excluded action  — any proposal to directly finalize a
                                machine-operation-execution decision
                                (e.g. deciding to proceed with a
                                specific textile/fur/leather machine
                                run), or a plant-safety-clearance
                                decision (e.g. declaring a plant or
                                production line safe for operation), or
                                to override a plant safety officer's
                                judgment, is a hard, permanent block
                                (checked both against the proposed :op
                                and, defense-in-depth, against the
                                proposal's :rationale text — matched as
                                full finalization/execution ACTION
                                phrases such as \"finalize the machine
                                operation\" / \"declare the plant safety
                                cleared\" / \"override the plant safety
                                officer's judgment\", never as bare
                                nouns like \"textile\", \"fur\" or
                                \"leather\", so the check can never
                                self-trip on the advisor's own routine
                                rationale text, e.g. \"logged work
                                record for operator …\" or \"scheduled
                                crew operation for textile/fur/leather
                                machine task …\" or \"…routed for plant
                                safety officer review\" — all three
                                legitimately contain bare domain nouns
                                but none is a finalization action, and
                                all are exercised by
                                `governor-test/default-mock-advisor-proposals-never-self-trip-on-scope-exclusion`).
  ESCALATION invariants (:escalate? true, ALWAYS human sign-off
  regardless of confidence):
    6. :op :flag-safety-concern (an entanglement / crush / equipment-
                                condition hazard concern always
                                escalates to a human, never
                                auto-commits).
    7. :op :coordinate-supply-order above `supply-cost-threshold`.
    8. low confidence (< `confidence-floor`).

  This actor coordinates plant scheduling/logistics ONLY — it never
  operates textile/fur/leather machinery itself, and it never makes a
  plant-safety-clearance decision itself; those decisions always route
  to a human plant safety officer, either via a hard permanent block on
  the op-allowlist (rules 4/5 above) or via a mandatory escalation
  (rule 6 above)."
