  "SSoT for the ISCO-08 8159 textile, fur and leather products machine
  operators (not elsewhere classified) plant scheduling/logistics
  coordination actor (itonami actor pattern, ADR-2607121000 / CLAUDE.md
  Actors section; README's 'Robotics premise' — a plant scheduling/
  logistics coordination robot performs crew scheduling, production-
  run/inventory/progress-record logging and raw-materials supply-order
  coordination for a textile/fur/leather products machine-operations
  crew under this advisor/governor pair, which never dispatches
  hardware itself, never operates textile/fur/leather machinery itself,
  and never finalizes a machine-operation-execution decision or a
  plant-safety-clearance decision, and never overrides a plant safety
  officer's judgment — those remain the plant safety officer's
  exclusive judgment). Modeled closely on cloud-itonami-isco-8122's
  platingcoord.store (metal finishing/plating/coating; this occupation
  group 8159 is a residual 'Not Elsewhere Classified' code covering
  diverse textile/fur/leather machine-operation work not captured by
  more specific ISCO 815x codes, so standard industrial-machine hazards
  — entanglement, crush injury from varied machinery — apply generically
  without a single dominant hazard type).

  Domain:

    operator — a registered textile/fur/leather products machine
               operator crew member (:operator-id, :name)
    plant    — a registered textile/fur/leather products plant/line
               {:plant-id :name :max-supply-cost number}.
               `:max-supply-cost` is an informational registered
               ceiling used only to decide whether a
               `:coordinate-supply-order` proposal escalates to human
               sign-off (the governor never blocks a within-threshold
               order outright; it only decides commit vs. escalate).
    record   — a committed operating record (a logged production-run/
               inventory/progress entry, a scheduled crew/shift
               operation, a flagged safety concern, or a coordinated
               raw-materials supply order) — written ONLY via
               commit-record!. This actor coordinates plant
               scheduling/logistics ONLY — a `record` is a
               coordination artifact, never a machine-operation-
               execution act, never a plant-safety-clearance decision,
               and never a plant safety officer's-judgment override.
